# Assembler instructions
## The assembler must be run from a command promt window.
## The assembler is written in ruby.
## Ruby must be installed on the computer where the assembler is being run.
## There are several files supplied along with the assembler.rb file:
## parser.rb, a_parser.rb, c_parser.rb, label_parser.rb, and variable_manager. 
## These files must be located in the same directory as the assembler.rb file.
## The assembler takes one arguement: the name of the .asm file.
## Example command: ruby assembler.rb Add.asm
## If an .asm file is not used as the first arguement, the assembler will throw and error.
## When the assembler runs, a .hack file will be created in the same directory as the .asm file.
